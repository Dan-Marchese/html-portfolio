<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everybody, my name is Dan and I am currently learning computer science and web development,
  I am a full time retail manager. I have been working in my current role for 10 years and I am looking to expand my knowledge
  by learning new skills outside of my current environment. I am married with three kids who are aged 10, 13 and 14.
  I am looking forward to learning more and developing my skills on this journey.</p>
